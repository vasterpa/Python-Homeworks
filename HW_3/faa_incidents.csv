WITH SPOTTERS FROM BOTH THE POLICE DEPARTMENT AND FIRE DEPARTMENT, THE UAV WAS FLOWN A DISTANCE OF 117FT FROM THE LAUNCH AREA OVER THE WATER, JUST BEYOND THE SHORELINE. THE UAV WAS POSITIONED 71FT ABOVE GROUND LEVEL (AGL) AND MAINTAINED THAT LOCATION AS I WALKED A SHORT DISTANCE TO THE SHORELINE. THE UAV WAS THEN LOWERED TO 33FT AGL TO BEGIN SEARCHING FOR THE VICTIM. AS THE UAV BEGAN TO ASCEND TO 37FT AGL THE CONNECTION WAS IMMEDIATELY LOST AND THE UAV BEGAN TO SLOWLY DESCEND AND EVENTUALLY LANDED IN THE WATER.
